This product is open source as is provided as-is, as per the terms of [the license](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme). Having said that, we do provide support in two different forms.

Note that we put out frequent releases of JiraMetrics. Before you report a bug, ensure that you're on the most recent version. It may already be fixed.

{: #free }
## Free support for bugs and feature requests

We provide free support via [Github issues](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics/issues). Open a ticket here and we will address your issue on a best-effort basis. While support this way is generally quick, recognize that we are not getting paid for this and have other jobs. We make no promises about how fast we'll get to it.

{: #paid }
## Paid support

Paid support for JiraMetrics is effectively a block of time where we help you. It could include any of the following:
* Fixing of bugs within JiraMetrics. Note that we're going to fix bugs anyway, having them fixed through paid support means that they get done according to your timeline, not ours.
* Setting up or configuring JiraMetrics in your environment.
* Teaching your people how to use JiraMetrics.
* Teaching your people how to read and understand the generated JiraMetrics reports.
* Creation of custom reports through JiraMetrics, to highlight things that matter to you.

If you wish to pay as you go, you can book an hour of [Mike Bowler's](https://mikebowler.ca) time [through Calendly](https://calendly.com/mikebowler/coaching-consulting) and pay immediately with a credit card. If you would like a more structured support contract or a larger block than just one hour then reach out to [sales@GargoyleSoftware.com](mailto:sales@GargoyleSoftware.com) and we'll be happy to help.
