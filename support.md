This product is open source as is provided as-is, as per the terms of [the license](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme). Having said that, we do provide support in two different forms.

Note that we put out frequent releases of JiraMetrics. Before you report a bug, ensure that you're on the most recent version. It may already be fixed.

## Free support for bugs and feature requests

We provide free support via [Github issues](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics/issues). Open a ticket here and we will address your issue on a best-effort basis. While support this way is generally quick, recognize that we are not getting paid for this and have other jobs. We make no promises about how fast we'll get to it.

## Paid support

Paid support could include the same bugs/features, only ensuring that they get prioritized faster. It could also include customization of reports for you, or training your team on how to make better decisions with this data.

If you wish to pay as you go, you can book an hour of [Mike's](https://mikebowler.ca) time [through Calendly](https://calendly.com/mikebowler/coaching-consulting) and pay immediately with a credit card. If you would like a more structured support contract or a larger block than just one hour then reach out to [sales@GargoyleSoftware.com](mailto:sales@GargoyleSoftware.com) and we'll be happy to help.
