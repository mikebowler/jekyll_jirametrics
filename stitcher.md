# The problem

We've found that although the individual reports are great for a single team, there is often a need to pull charts together out of many different reports to make a single consolidated report.

The idea behind the stitcher is that we're going to build one new HTML file by pulling pieces from other reports that are already generated.

# The mechanics

You will create a new ERB file that is the template for the new report. Something like this.

```erb
This is a sample report with a single chart below.

<%= grab_by_title 'Cycletime Scatterplot', from_file: 'target/myproject.html' %>

Here is some more text below the chart.
```

The line starting with `grab_by_title` is where the chart gets extracted from an already existing report. It will in the specified file for a chart with the specified title and will then include that in the new consolidated report.

{: .tip }
It's only going to be able to extract charts from reports already generated by `jirametrics` v2.22 or higher, not from random HTML files that you have lying around. We now embed markers in the HTML that allow us to do this extraction.

To run the stitcher, call `jirametrics stitch <filename>` where `<filename>` is the name of the ERB file that you created above. If you started with `foo.erb` then it will create a file called `foo.html`.
