JiraMetrics was written by Mike Bowler, to satisfy his own need to get decent metrics out of Jira.

The tool itself is Open Source and released under an Apache license and that means you can use it for free. If you wish to purchase support or training then [contact Mike](https://gargoylesoftware.com/mike_bowler/followup/). We can help you set it up and walk your teams through the reports to understand their own data.

* If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, [report it on our GitHub page](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics/issues).
* If you want to contribute then check out the github projects for [the tool itself](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics) or for [the documentation](https://github.com/mikebowler/jekyll_jirametrics) and submit a PR.
