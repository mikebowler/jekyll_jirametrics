JiraMetrics was written by [Mike Bowler](https://gargoylesoftware.com/mike_bowler/followup/) of [Gargoyle Software](https://gargoylesoftware.com), to satisfy his own need to get decent metrics out of Jira. The tool itself is Open Source and released under an Apache license and that means you can use it for free. 

This tool has been made better by the contributions of many people, who have offered feedback, bug reports, and occasionally code contributions.

* If you wish to purchase support or training then [contact Mike](https://gargoylesoftware.com/mike_bowler/followup/). We can help you set it up and walk your teams through the reports to understand their own data.
* If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, [report it on our GitHub page](https://github.com/mikebowler/jirametrics/issues). 
	* Problems with the documentation are also considered bugs although they're in a different project so [log them over here](https://github.com/mikebowler/jekyll_jirametrics/issues).
* If you want to contribute then [check out the contribution page]({% link contributing.md %}) and submit a PR.
